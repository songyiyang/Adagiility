Mini project in adagility

Project Summary
Staples has asked AdAgility to design a new ad container for their homepage that will present users with one of several credit card processing products including: Square, PayPal, Intuit, or Pay Anywhere. Eventually Staples might want to ad additional advertisers into the mix. To work on this project you can save a copy of this page and work on it locally.

Project Requirements:
Use javascript, css, html to show an ad to a user and dynamically insert it into the container provided below
Use the ads JSON object to determine the headline, line_1, and line_2 text
Include a way for the user to click the ad so they can visit the advertiser website
Use javascript / randomization to pick which ad to show (only one ad should be displayed to the user)
Additional Ideas to Consider (extra credit):
Use the advertiser_weight value to increase/decrease the chances of the ad showing up. The higher the weight the better the chance of the ad showing up.
Consider extra styles, UI/UX tweaks for the ad
Add a photo or logo thumbnail to each ad to make it more visually appealing
Can your solution handle an instance where no ads are available? How about 10 ads in the JSON ads object?
Consider allowing users to scroll left or right to view the other ads
Consider allowing a new ad to appear every 5 seconds
